# HyCGA-Transformer
Implementation for Shape from polarization via ultra-low-sampling single-pixel imaging with decoupled spatial and polarimetric dimensions

# Introduction
This study pioneers the integration of the deep undersampling advantage of single-pixel imaging (SPI) with SfP technology, proposing a SPI ultra-low-sampling SfP architecture based on decoupled spatial and polarimetric dimensions.

# Dependencies and Installation
